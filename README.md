# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **@letsdeepchat**, a backend developer passionate about building robust and scalable web applications using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **PostgreSQL**. I enjoy crafting efficient APIs, architecting clean backend services, and working with databases to deliver performant, data-driven solutions.

## What Iâ€™m Working On

Iâ€™m currently focused on:

- Developing production-ready APIs using FastAPI  
- Implementing secure authentication flows with JWT  
- Integrating third-party services like **Masters India GST APIs**  
- Containerizing applications using **Docker**  
- Managing asynchronous tasks and optimizing database interactions
